MASCLET framework

Provides several functions to read MASCLET outputs and perform basic operations.
Also, serves as a bridge between MASCLET data and the yt package (v 3.5.1).

    Given a patch in a certain iteration, finds the grid (natural) coordinates of its left corner.

    Given a patch in a certain iteration, finds the real coordinates of its left corner with no numerical error.

        side: side of the simulation box in the chosen units (typically Mpc or kpc) (float)
