"""
MASCLET framework

Provides several functions to read MASCLET outputs and perform basic operations.
Also, serves as a bridge between MASCLET data and the yt package (v 3.5.1).

masclet4yt module
Aims to serve as a user-friendly link between masclet software and the yt
package

    This function creates a list of dictionaries containing the information requiered for yt's load_amr_grids
    to build the grid structure of a simulations performed by MASCLET.

    Args:
        it: iteration number (int)
        path: path of the grids file in the system (str)
        digits: number of digits the filename is written with (int)
        kept_patches: 1d boolean array, True if the patch is kept, False if not.
                    If None, all patches are kept.

    Returns:
        grid_data: list of dictionaries, each containing the information about one refinement patch (left_edge,
        right_edge, level and dimensions [number of cells])
        bbox: bounds of the simulation box in physical coordinates (typically Mpc or kpc)
